# Customer Churn Analysis Dashboard (Power BI)
This project analyzes customer churn using Power BI to identify key factors influencing customer retention. The insights support data-driven decision-making aimed at improving customer retention and reducing churn.


## Project Overview

The goal is to understand customer churn behavior and identify key factors influencing customer retention. The dashboard provides high-level KPIs as well as detailed breakdowns across customer demographics, tenure, and service-related attributes to support data-driven decision-making.
